This code cleans an Excel file containing information about gene mutations by:
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Checking for inconsistencies

Next it analyzes the data, looking for SNV type mutations and filters out any other mutation types.

Then it merges the Excel file with a .csv file containing some genomic data, like gene locations and names by matching the mutation positions and gene locations.
